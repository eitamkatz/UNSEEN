## The work of Gal 💪
 * Rotation of the LightHouse and the Gaurds
 * Detaction of the Player by the LightHouse and Gaurds
 * Transitions scenes (openning, game over and winning)


## The work of Eitam 💪
 * Movement + Jump
 * Turn on and off the shadows of objects outside the frame
 * Player's animation
 * Level design


## Hard parts 😓
 * Make the shadows appeare only near the player 
 * Detaction of the Player only when he expose the light


## feedback 🤔
 * The main feedback was that the shadows are to long, so we decided to turn on and off the shadows objects according the player distance.


## play-tests conclusions 🎮
 * we have been told that the game is too hard so we made game difficulty adjustments:
    - Zoomed out the camera
    - Decreased light rotation speed
    - Increased player jump distance


## bugs 🐛
 * NONE 🤞
